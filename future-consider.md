The Canonical Schema Discussion Points:
density field - Legitimate bulk density data (2.44-2.50 g/cmÂ³) from RHOB curves
Missing petrophysical fields - We're finding real measurements that don't fit the current schema
Field mapping strategy - Should we expand the schema or be more aggressive about moving to remarks?

## FUTURE PARSER IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. Catch-All Parser Strategy
**Problem**: Currently, files that don't match any configured extension are ignored
**Proposed Solution**: Use UnstructuredParser as a catch-all parser for unknown file types

**Implementation Ideas**:
- Add a "catch-all" mode to UnstructuredParser that accepts any file type
- Modify file classification logic to route unmatched files to UnstructuredParser
- Create a fallback chain: Structured â Unstructured â Ignore

**Benefits**:
- No data loss - all files get processed somehow
- Leverages Unstructured SDK's broad file type support
- Provides vector searchable content for unknown file types

### 2. Structured Parser Fallback Strategy
**Problem**: If structured parsers fail, files are completely lost
**Proposed Solution**: Implement fallback to UnstructuredParser when structured parsing fails

**Implementation Ideas**:
- Add error handling in structured parsers to catch parsing failures
- Implement retry logic: Structured Parser â Unstructured Parser
- Track which files were processed via fallback vs primary method

**Benefits**:
- Higher success rate for file processing
- Graceful degradation when structured parsing fails
- Maintains data accessibility even with parsing errors

### 3. Enhanced File Classification
**Current**: Binary classification (structured vs unstructured vs ignored)
**Proposed**: Multi-tier classification with fallbacks

**Classification Tiers**:
1. **Primary Structured**: LAS, DLIS, CSV with dedicated parsers
2. **Secondary Structured**: Other structured formats (JSON, XML, etc.)
3. **Primary Unstructured**: PDF, DOC, XLSX with UnstructuredParser
4. **Catch-All Unstructured**: Unknown files via UnstructuredParser
5. **Ignored**: Only truly unprocessable files (corrupted, system files)

### 4. Configuration-Driven Fallbacks
**Proposed .env Configuration**:
```bash
# Primary structured parsers
STRUCTURED_FILE_TYPES=.las,.dlis,.csv

# Primary unstructured parsers  
UNSTRUCTURED_FILE_TYPES=.pdf,.docx,.xlsx,.txt

# Fallback behavior
ENABLE_CATCH_ALL_PARSER=true
ENABLE_STRUCTURED_FALLBACK=true
MAX_FALLBACK_ATTEMPTS=2
```

### 5. Processing Pipeline Improvements
**Current Flow**:
```
File â Classification â Single Parser â Output
```

**Proposed Flow**:
```
File â Classification â Primary Parser â Success?
                                    â No
                              Fallback Parser â Success?
                                              â No
                                        Log & Ignore
```

### 6. Monitoring and Analytics
**Track Processing Methods**:
- Primary structured parsing success rate
- Fallback unstructured parsing success rate
- File types that frequently need fallbacks
- Performance impact of fallback processing

**Benefits**:
- Identify which file types need dedicated parsers
- Optimize processing pipeline based on actual usage
- Improve success rates over time

### 7. Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Add catch-all UnstructuredParser for unmatched files
2. **Phase 2**: Implement structured parser fallback to unstructured
3. **Phase 3**: Enhanced configuration and monitoring
4. **Phase 4**: Performance optimization and analytics

### 8. Considerations
- **Performance**: Fallback processing adds overhead
- **Quality**: Unstructured parsing may be less precise than structured
- **Storage**: More files processed = more storage requirements
- **Complexity**: More complex error handling and retry logic
